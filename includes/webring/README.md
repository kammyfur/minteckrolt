# Jae's Ftech webring widget for PHP
A widget for Jae's Ftech webring made in PHP. If you want to do stuff client-side, Jae made a quick-and-dirty implementation [on her website](https://jae.fi/announcements/webring-implementation.md).

Mine is different because it doesn't depend on JavaScript, runs everything server-side, and is made to be future-proof.

> Special note: As part of a project to improve reliability on my servers, it is possible that this widget will, in the future, be rewritten to use NodeJS instead of PHP. This is not happening currently so you can safely use the widget on a production site.
