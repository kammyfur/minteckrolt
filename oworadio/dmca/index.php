    <h1>How OwORadio handles DMCA takedown requests?</h1>
    <p>If you deem a content streamed through the OwORadio service is infringing copyright laws, you can ask us to
        remove the aforementioned content. All your reports should be diriged to <a
                href="mailto:nekostarfan+dmca@gmail.com">nekostarfan+dmca@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are the owner of the content (and you can prove being so), you can kindly ask us to remove the content
        without a DMCA takedown request. <b>The following content is ONLY for DMCA requests and don't apply to simpler
            requests.</b></p>
    <p>Since the content is hosted in Europe, and that the service is operating within the European Union, we will not
        consider any DMCA requests that didn't received an order from an European tribunal. OwORadio must not be
        required to restrict content unless an order has been issued by an independant and impartial judicial
        authority that has determined that the material at issue is unlawful.</p>
    <p>No information that you provide through your DMCA request (even without respecting the aforementioned rules) will
        be disclosed outside of the legal procedure.</p>
